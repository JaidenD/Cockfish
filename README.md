# Cockfish
Cockfish is an intentionally bad chess engine. Cockfish has several shitty chess algorithms / tactics, for an example: Random Move, Always Take (if possible), never Take(again, if possible), etc... New algorithms will be added overtime. Cockfish has two modes, player vs Cockfish, and Cockfish vs Cockfish.
